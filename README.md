# Simple Linear Regression - RealEstate Price
Simple Linear Regression Model -
Real Estate price prediction

# The general dataset in this repo is as follows:
1.RealEstate_TLV: 80% training data
                  20% test data

**the dataset from "nadlan.gov.il"**
The data refers to 3 room apartment in Dizengoff st TLV

# The goal of this project was to practice:
1.Bulding Simple Linear Regression Model

2.uesing sklean lab for split data into training set and test set

3.visualizations clearly in Python
